    Your title must match the article's headline exactly, and/or be a quote from the article that accurately represents the content.
    
    **Note: Using Reddit's 'Submit Title' does not always give the exact title, it's not recommended to use this feature & instead copy/paste the title from the article.** 

3. Do not use ALL CAPS, or use “BREAKING” in your titles.

4. Do not submit links to wikis, images, memes. Political cartoons & detailed info-graphics should be linked to their original source.

5. **Submit from the original source of the article.** [Blogspam and rehosted content will be removed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_blogspam)
