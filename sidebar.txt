:-:|:-:
Be civil|Treat others with basic decency. No personal attacks, hate-speech, flaming, baiting, trolling, witch-hunting, or unsubstantiated accusations. Threats of violence will result in a ban. [More Info.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_please_be_civil)

Vote based on quality, not opinion.|Political discussion requires varied opinions. Well written and interesting content can be worthwhile, even if you disagree with it.

[More Info.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_voting)
Do not manipulate comments and posts via group voting.|Manipulating comments and posts via group voting is against reddit TOS. [More Info.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_do_not_manipulate_comments_and_posts_via_group_voting.)

Articles must be published within the last 45 days.|[More Info.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_the_.2Fr.2Fpolitics_on_topic_statement)

Submissions must be an original source.|An article must contain significant analysis and original content--not just a few links of text among chunks of copy and pasted material.
